### Revisions

Though we avoid changing names or glyphs as much as possible to keep the library stable for everyone, weâ€™ll push a change when we believe itâ€™s important long-term for the cohesion, clarity, and readability of each icon and the icon system. We're working on being more transparent on these changes for every release.

#### Notable changes:

- Name change: `pedestrian` â†’ `person`
- Glyph change: `user-gear`, `user-plus`, and `user-minus` have been revised from a cutout treatment to separate elements to improve readability and an awkward treatment of the fill weight; moving forward this will help us build out a better user set

- Glyph change: `floppy-disk` now depicts the front of a floppy disk and `floppy-disk-back` carries forth the previous treatment, with an adjustment to the beveled corner for accuracy ðŸ¤“

- Added duotone treatments for: `atom`, `push-pin-slash`, `push-pin-simple-slash`, `arrow-square-in`, `arrow-square-out`
- Added fill treatments for the arrow set

### Optical adjustments:

- Better alignment (shield set, `info`)
- Less anchor points / anchor point bug fixes (smiley set, gear set, `github-logo`)
- Better readability (`coffee-bold`)
- Consistency in scale (`lamp`, `monitor-play`, `fast-forward-circle`, `rewind-circle`, `twitter-logo`, `linkedin-logo`, `arrows-down-up`, `arrows-left-right`)
- Better fill treatment (`note-pencil`, `pencil-circle`)
- Consistency in like icons (`hand-palm`, `hand-waving`, `paint-brush-broad`, `link-bold`, `cloud-fog-fill`)
